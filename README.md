## Algorithms
This repository contains the solutions to the exercises from each chapter of the book, these solutions are meant to be 
helpful for those who want learn fundamental algorithms for sorting, searching, graphs and strings.

This book is widely used to study important and useful data structures and algorithms. The algorithms in this book were
developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensable, not just for programmers and computer science students 
but for any student with interests in science, mathematics, and engineering.

>Performance is a central consideration in the study of algorithms. Section 1.4 describes our approach to analyzing 
> algorithm performance. The basis of our approach is the scientific method: we develop hypotheses about performance, 
> create mathematical models, and run experiments to test them, repeating the process as necessary. (page 3)
